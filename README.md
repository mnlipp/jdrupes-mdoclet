**Please note that starting with version 2.0.0 the doclet works with the API 
introduced in Java 9. It has been tested with Java 11.**

A Doclet that allows the use of Markdown in JavaDoc. It uses a configurable 
Markdown processor
([flexmark-java](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java) by default). 
Basically, the doclet intercepts the standard doclet's access to the AST 
generated by the javadoc tool and converts the texts from the comments 
from markdown to HTML.

See the [javadoc overview](https://mnlipp.github.io/jdrupes-mdoclet/javadoc/)
for details. 

 * Version 2.1.0 fixes a problem that caused a class cast exception 
   with JDK 15+ when javadoc tries to report a warning.
